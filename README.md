# Medivault

**MediVault** is an EHR app, where users (i.e. patients) can keep track of their own hospital visits, prescriptions and history. 

Users can store their hospital visits, the prescription, the diagnosis as well as prognosis advised by the doctor. 

Users can also set alarms for their medications, specifying the time and quantity of a particular medicine.

Using a distinct code generated by the hospital, the patient history can be accessed by the hosptials only in case of emergencies . Users can also set emergency contacts.

## Technology Stack 
- NextJS Pages 
- Konsta UI Framework -> Beautiful UI Library
- Auth0 -> A wonderful library to ease authentication
- MongoDB Atlas -> To Store User Information like prescriptions, records etc

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

### Developing Locally


```bash
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

## What's next for MediVault ?
In the future, as we learn more about these technologies, we want to create a unified healthcare app where both the doctor and the patients are users and doctors can directly see patient history on their side of the app. This will make the experience of visiting a doctor even smoother and stress free!

Also a feature to share medical journal with family members
